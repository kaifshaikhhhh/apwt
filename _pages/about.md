I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering at D.Y. Patil International University, specializing in the fascinating realm of AI. I have a strong interest in various research areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence, including Large Language Models, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Adversary Machine Learning, Interpretability. In my studies and independent projects, I actively work with state-of-the-art AI technologies to expand my expertise. I am particularly passionate about conducting research at the intersection of data-driven NLP, TrustworthyML, computer vision, generative AI models. I am always eager to tackle new challenges that combine my enthusiasm for technology with interdisciplinary collaboration. My goal is to conduct research that manifests theoretical ideas into practical tools with measurable impact. I believe bringing together diverse perspectives leads to truly transformative innovation.
