Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Science at D.Y. Patil International University, graduating in 2025. Iâ€™m deeply curious about AI and how we can build systems that are both powerful and trustworthy. My work mainly revolves around natural language processing (NLP), human-AI interaction, and privacy-preserving machine learning.

Currently, Iâ€™m involved in research at two places. At CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, I'm working on auditing and improving privacy techniques for generative models, especially diffusion and autoregressive models. Iâ€™m also collaborating with the Indian School of Business, where Iâ€™m building NLP pipelines to analyze sensitive news data â€” combining large language models with tools like OCR and classification systems to structure messy real-world information.

Across these projects, Iâ€™m exploring how to make machine learning systems more private, reliable, and aligned with human values. My goal is to work at the intersection of ethics and cutting-edge AI, and contribute to systems that are not only smart but safe.
